Limbo~
You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

The Zombie Pen~
This extremely strange-looking room seems to contain dozens of zombies and
other charmed creatures penned up like livestock. Zombies of dead dragons
stand mindlessly next to towering fire elementals. In one corner, you see a
couple pigs in a pen that seem rather out of place. What a horrible, horrible
place.

The Description Room~
You are traped in a void of reflective nothingness, unable to move you
start to panic as all you can see is yourself.  Rather the poor appearence
of yourself.  Perhaps that your vision of what you look like could be
improved.  As you start to think hard about what you look like you notice
features of your body start to alter as you think more indepth about each
part.  Clothes and armours weapons and equipment all start to blur as your
mind races as to what you may wear.  Still traped in this void of reflective
nothingness you wonder about HELP RULES and HELP DESCRIPTION.  At least now
you are no longer struck with panic, once your heart has stopped beating so
rapidly, perhaps praying for a way out might prove more fruitful.
