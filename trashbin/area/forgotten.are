a monstrosity~
A humongous monstrosity lurks in the rockchamber.
~
A humongous lump of armored flesh, the monstrosity nearly fills the small
chamber.  Large, black plates are scaled one over the other, covering an
huge oval body.  More to the front, nearby the tentacles the plates separate
and reveal a single eyeball, more then three feet across.  All across the
caves lie the crushed remains of skeletons and broken weaponary of previous
adventurers, all victims of its eternal hunger.

a monstrous tentacle~
A monstrous tentacle flails about the water.
~
At first glance this monstrous tentacle could have easily been mistaken
for a huge snake, writhing over the cavefloor.  Yet its flailing behaviour
quickly betrays it as the tentacle of some kind of monstrosity.  Its skin is
covered with small jagged scales, it lacks head or eyes, and it seems to
originate from one of the deeper recesses in the cavern.

Held by a gigantous tentacle, you are hauled through the water at high

fishscales, their tips ending in barbed hooks.  Your thoughts divert and you
ponder briefly on where the tentacle is taking you.

out of here quickly, either by blade or magic, your future might be black

Southern edge of the plateau~
This part of the plateau is squeezed between the southern mountainside
and an elongated slope from the western side.  With so little sun ever
reaching this part of the plateau, the walls are covered with moist and
algae.  To the south a small cave entrance is heavily draped with a curtain
of red-flowered vines.  While the normal villagelife bustled to the east,
people seem to avoid this part of the plateau.

A shamanic cove~
The cove is cramped, as in every nook and cranny all sorts of jawbones,
jugals, teeth and skulls are stashed.  Most are decorated with henna
drawings, while others are tied to various herbs with pieces of strings.  In
the midst of this all is a bare patch on the ground where a large pentagram
is drawn into the floor.  A curtain of red-flowered vines separates the cave
entrance from the world outside.

An ascending path~
The steps of this stairway are hewed in this once-natural fissure.  The
walls have been chiseled and polished with care.  The erratic twists and
turn limit your view to only half a dozen yards.  To the south, the fissure
provides passage to the plateau, while north it ascends higher up the
mountainslope.

A junction of paths~
The fissure here splits in two, one descending north, one descending onto
the southern part of the plateau.  The steps of this stairway are
meticulously hewed and the walls have been chiseled and polished with care. 
The erratic twists and turn limit your view to only half a dozen yards.  As
the fissure narrows to the west, it becomes even steeper, and the individual
steps are barely large enough for an abyss' foot.

A hidden terrace~
The fissure gives way for a small terrace , nearly a hundred foot above
the plateau itself.  Not only does it show a magnificient view of the
plateau itself, but it also shows the hill landscape that lies beyond the
ridge enfolding the village.  To the west, an altar of some sort can be
discerned.  The steps of the path leading down are meticulously hewed and
the walls have been chiseled and polished with care.

A hidden terrace~
The mountain makes way for a small terrace , nearly a hundred foot above
the plateau itself.  Not only does it show a magnificient view of the
plateau itself, but it also shows the hill landscape that lies beyond the
ridge.  A gruesome altar has been crafted out of a large block of obsidian
granite, depicting a young child entangled by four monstrous tentacles.  The
steps of the path leading down are meticulously hewed and the walls have
been chiseled and polished with care.

Northern pass~
The slopes of the ridge confine the pass to a narrow trail.  The slippery
remains of a rockslide do not ease travelling and the fog that limits the
view to the north obscures any details that might be discerned of the
plateau to the south.

Southeastern corner of the plateau~
The hidden plateau spreads out majestically to the north and west,
displaying a small village isolated from the world outside.  People are
milling about caves that are hewn into the mountain itself, and a few have
gathered around the triangular lake that lies in the centre of the valley. 
A massive boulder towers above you, easily as large as a palace.  The
surface of the boulder suggests that it once was part of the mountain
itself, but that it broke away hundreds of years ago.  Now a small pass has
formed between the mountain and the boulder, winding its way down.

At the shores of a lake~
The lake lies in the center of the plateau.  Overshadowed by the mountain
peaks, it is dark and still.  Not a ripple caresses its surface.  All around
you, the plateau stretches to the unforgiving rock walls that enclose it. 
In several directions villagers are milling about, fulfilling their tasks. 
Lining the lake are some clay cauldrons, used by the savages to store their
catches.

Within a lake~
A few yards below the surface the world exists only in shades of black. 
The rough walls of the lake are covered with algae, and small schools of
fish rush through their world, fading in and out of sight.  Further down,
the lake narrows, giving it the shape of a giant funnel.  Strange currents
whirl and threathen to carry you away into the deep.  Underwater, the
gibberish of the savages has dimmed beyond hearing and an eerie silence is
all that is left behind.

Deep within a lake~
No surface light comes this deep, and the giant funnel's walls are smooth
and slimy with algae.  Strong currents whirl the water around.  Life becomes
rare here, and only far above school of fish can be still be seen flashing
by.  A few brightly coloured snails cling to the rock walls, grazing the
luminiscent algae.  Some whelks are actively preying on the grazing snails,
their feelers blindly searching for flesh to devour.

Before an underwater lair~
The currents seem to originate from an jagged cavemouth to the west. 
With the very little light that penetrates these depths, the weak
luminescence originating from deeper within the cave acts like a beacon. 
The hard rockbed on the bottom of the floor of the lake is covered with a
thick layer of mucus.  Several small stones are slowly sliding deeper into
the lair, dragged in by the strong currents.

The walls of the aisle are covered with a thick layer of mucus, aglow
with the luminiscence of small algae.  Large anemones wave their tentacles,
filtering the water for any edible remains.  East, the darkness of the
lake's water looms, while to the west a faint glow reveals that the aisle
widens into a large cavern.  The currents pull you towards it, in an
insistent, nearly conscious way.

Monumental in size, this underwater chamber stretches out to the north,

illuminate the scene.  Darting through them little squids, nearly
translucent in colour, their arms grabbing at invisible prey.  Overhead, the
light breaks and plays through the small ripples of an unknown water
surface.  To the east, a small aisle offers a way out of the cavern.

A small air bubble~
A stale and moist air bubble is captured in the ceiling of the cavern. 
The rocks are still wet enough to host some luminescent algae, and a few
polyps cling to the stone just above the water surface.  The algae's light
is shattered upon the rippling waves, making it impossible to see what lies
beneath the watersurface.

scattered across its surface.  To the east, the grotto opens into a cavern.

Everything around you bulges and convexes, mangled by gigantous muscles
in the stomach of the tentacled beast.  Various acid juices pour out of
glands, their sharp and dizzying fumes mixing with the putrid odour of the
half-digested carrion residing here.  You realize that unless you find a way
out of here quickly, either by blade or magic, your future might be black

Held by a gigantous tentacle, you are hauled through the water at high

study your captor.  The large slimy tentacle is covered with small jagged
fishscales, their tips ending in barbed hooks.  Your thoughts divert and you
ponder briefly on where the tentacle is taking you.
